\chapter{Sequence Formats}


ToPS can read two distinct text-based file format: (1) FASTA; (2) ToPS sequence format.  

\section {FASTA format}

FASTA format has become a standard in the field of Bioinformatics and it represents any sequence data such as  nucleotide sequences or protein sequences.

A sequence in FASTA format always begins with a single-line description, followed by the lines of the sequence data.  The description line begins with the greater-than (">") symbol. The sequence data ends when another ">" appears or when the end-of-file is encountered.

\section{ToPS sequence format}

ToPS sequence format assumes that each line contains a single sequence data. 
A sequence in ToPS format consists of a sequence name, followed by a colon (":"), a space, and the sequence data, where symbols are separated by spaces.  ToPS allows the  multiple-character symbols as can be seen in the second example below.
